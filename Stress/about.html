    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Two of our members are rising seniors and we have been faces with immense stress<br>due to college applications being due in the next few month. In our summer, we<br>participated in a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. This<br>class taught us how to code and create websites. As our final project, we realized<br>that stress was a major conflict in al of our lives, so we wanted to create a<br>website that featured stress relief activities and tips.</p>
